# Kuco Coin

This is an implementation of a non-meme token on Avalanche. It has real world functionalities, like things and such, so it's definitely not a pyramid scheme. The code has also been audited by the author during implementation.


## Ideas

Buy KucoCoin. it's meaningless, but so is your life.

## Thanks to
- Avalanche for honestly being the best chain,
- Uniswap for deploying their V2 on Avalanche,
- People that developed [Namari](https://onepagelove.com/namari) for their free template hacked into KucoCoin frontend,
- To this guy for the [spiral animation](https://jsfiddle.net/j08691/CKWrN/),
- To this guy for the [windows95 error tab in css](https://codepen.io/jkantner/pen/oNypPOZ),
- To this guy that updated [UniwapV2 for Solidity 0.8.4](https://github.com/islishude/uniswapv2-solc0.8).
